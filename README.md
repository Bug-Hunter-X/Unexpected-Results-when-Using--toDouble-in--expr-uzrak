# MongoDB Query Bug: Unexpected Results with $toDouble in $expr

This repository demonstrates a potential issue when using the `$toDouble` operator within the `$expr` operator in a MongoDB query.  The bug arises when attempting to compare a field that might not be a number directly to a numeric value.

The provided `bug.js` file contains a query that uses `$toDouble` to convert a field to a double before comparison. If the field's value cannot be converted to a double (e.g., it's a string or a non-numeric type), `$toDouble` returns `null`. Comparing `null` to a number results in unexpected behavior.  The query might not return the intended results, and can lead to unexpected filtering and data retrieval.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to rectify the issue.
